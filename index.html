			<h1>Justin's Personal Website</h1>
				<p>Hello, my name is Justin Jeffrey. I am here working on my software engineering degree at Oakland Community College!</p>
				<p>My favorite way to spend my free time is playing Magic the Gathering, a popular card battler game. So I've decided to build this website around Magic. I'll be talking about some of my favorite decks I've made, while exercising what I've learned from HTML.</p>

			<h2>Meria, Scholar of Antiquity</h2>
			<img src="./images/meria.jpg" alt="Meria, Scholar of Antiquity" width="300" class="center" title="Why fear artifice? Is it not also of this world?">
				<p>The first deck I'm going to be discussing is also the simplest. Meria, Scholar of Antiquity is a 3/3 creature for three mana who has two activated abilities. The first is <q>Tap an untapped nontoken artifact you control: Add one green mana.</q> The second is <q>Tap two untapped nontoken artifacts you control: Exile the top card of your library. You may play it this turn.</q> When this card was released last year, I was really excited for it. She is in the color identity of red and green, which does not normally synergize with artifacts, but Meria does which is unique. There's this old Magic card called Mox Emerald. It's so strong is banned in a lot of formats. Its a zero cost artifact that taps to add a green mana. If Meria is in play, all of my artifacts tap for a green mana. Often creating cards that are even more powerful than Mox Emerald. Most people would build this deck as an artifact synergy deck, but I saw this card and thought how interesting it would be to build her as a voltron deck. That is, to buff her up crazy big with equipment. Equipment are also artifacts which require mana to equip. Meria allows me to tap my equipment to equip themselves, and then attempt to one shot someone with commander damage (21 points of damage from Meria).</p>
				<p>So what's in this deck? First off we have a lot of silly zero mana artifacts that we can turn into Mox Emeralds: <ul> <li>Spellbook<li>Darksteel Relic<li>Welding Jar </ul> 
				<p>Then we have low mana artifacts that can slow down our opponents, which Meria can also tap for mana such as: <ul> <li>Crawlspace<li>Torpor Orb<li>Grafdigger's Cage </ul> 
				<p>Then of course we have some powerful equipment to buff up Meria such as: <ul> <li>Thran Power Suit<li>Blackblade Reforged<li>Shadowspear </ul>
				<p>This deck is a pretty fast glass cannon. It either works or it doesn't. Almost no in-between. The first five turns or so are just casting artifacts and passing. After I have a good number of equipment on the battlefield, and some protection for Meria, it's time to cast her and use the artifacts to pay for equipment costs. Load her up and send her swinging. Some of the protective spells I have in the deck include Snakeskin Veil, Veil of Summer, and Tamiyo's Safekeeping. Some of the removal spells I have in the deck are Beast Within, Soul's Fire, and Return to Nature.</p>

			<h2>Reyhan, Last of the Abzan</h2>
			<img src="./images/reyhan_last_of_the_abzan.jpg" alt="Reyhan, Last of the Abzan" width="300" class="center">
				<p>Another of my favorite decks revolves around the commander Reyhan, Last of the Abzan. He is a three mana cost creature that is a 0/0, but enters the battlefield with three +1/+1 counters. He has a triggered ability that reads <q>Whenever a creature you control dies or is put into the command zone, if it had one or more +1/+1 counters on it, you may put that many +1/+1 counters on target creature.</q> The goal of this deck is to put +1/+1 counters on my creatures to make them big, and then sacrifice them to make other creatures even bigger. I think it beautifully pictures a life and death cycle. Or something along the lines of my creatures feeding off of my other creatures to make them stronger. Survival of the fittest. So what's in this deck?</p>
				<p>First off are creatures that get +1/+1 counters such as:<ul> <li>Ochre Jelly<li>Managorger Hydra<li>Grakmaw, Skyclave Ravager </li> </ul>
				<p>Then there are creatures that double my +1/+1 counters such as:<ul> <li>Corpsejack Menace<li>Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider</ul>
				<p>Once I get these creatures into play, its time to kill them. With spells that gain benefits like: <ul> <li>Momentous Fall <li>Village Rites<li>Greater Good </ul> 
				<p>Then my commander triggers, moving the +1/+1 counters. I have two cards in the deck that mimic Reyhan's ability. If they are on the battlefield, I don't need Reyhan. If they are on the battlefield, they essentially double his ability. They are: <ul> <li>Death's Presence <li>The Ozolith </ul>
				<p>From here, we just attack with the biggest creature on the battlefield. Cards like Shadowspear and Rancor give us the attacking advantage. Card like Assassin's Trophy, Putrefy, and Beast Within help us remove our opponent's permanents. Cards like Reanimate and Animate Dead return our creatures to the battlefield when they die.</p>
				<p>If I am unable to win through combat damage, I have thrown in Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord as a secret win condition. Once I make a big creature, I can use Jarad's activated ability to sacrifice it and each opponent loses life equal to the creature's power.</p>

			<h2>Atemsis, All-Seeing</h1>
			<img src="./images/atemsis_all_seeing.jpg" alt="Atemsis, All-Seeing" width="300" class="center">
				<p>This next deck revolves around the commander Atemsis, All-Seeing. She is a 4/5 flying creature that costs six mana. She has an activated ability that says <q>Pay 3 mana and tap: Draw two cards, then discard a card</q>. She has a triggered ability that says <q>Whenever Atemsis deal damage to an opponent, you may reveal your hand. If cards with at least six different mana values are revealed this way, that player loses the game.</q> So the goal of this deal is to draw as many cards as possible. Once I get at least six different mana valued cards in my hand, I can cast Atemsis and try to one shot someone with her triggered ability. How do we get there?</p>
				<p>Step one is to draw a lot of cards. Cards that help get us there: <ul> <li>Teferi's Ageless Insight<li>Flow of Knowledge<li>Consecrated Sphinx </ul>
				<p>Step two is control our opponents. This deck is 99% defense. The 1% is when we cast Atemsis. Cards that will keep us safe include: <ul> <li>Snapback<li>Flood of Tears<li>Meishin, the Mind Cage </ul>
				<p>The deck also contains a lot of counterspells  to slow down our opponents and prevent them from using their combos if they have any. These spells include: <ul> <li>Disallow<li>Thought Collapse<li>Archmage's Charm </ul>
				<p>A safe time to cast Atemsis is when we have a lot of cards in hand and at least two counterspells, because our opponents will try to kill Atemsis when she hits the battlefield. After the coast is clear, we can equip her with Sorcerer's Wand or enchant her with Hermetic Study. These give her the ability to "Tap: This creature deals 1 damage to target player." From here, we simply tap her, deal 1 damage to an opponent, her ability triggers, we reveal our hand to reveal at least six different mana values, and that player loses the game. Ideally, we also have this land in play called Minamo, School at Water's Edge. It allows us to pay one mana to untap a legendary permanent. With this in play, we can untap Atemsis and kill two opponents in one turn.</p>
				<p>But of course, never leave home without more than one win condition. If Atemsis fails for whatever reason, we have Triskaidekaphile and Jace, Wielder of Mysteries. Triskaidekaphile says <q>At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have exactly thirteen cards in your hand, you win the game.</q> Jace, Wielder of Mysteries says <q>If you would draw a card while your library has no cards in it, you win the game instead.</q> Easy enough to do in this deck.</p>

			<h2>Sivitri, Dragon Master</h2>
			<img src="./images/sivitri.jpg" alt="Sivitri, Dragon Master" width="300" class="center" title="Even the brave have cause to tremble at the sight of Sivitri Scarzam. Who else has tamed Scarzam's Dragon?">
				<p>The last deck I'm going to discuss is also the most complicated. Sivitri, Dragon Master is a planeswalker who has three abilities that you can use once per turn. She costs four mana and starts with four loyalty. You can add a loyalty to activate the ability <q>Until your next turn, creatures can't attack you or planeswalkers you control unless their controller pays 2 life for each of those creatures.</q> You can take away three loyalty to activate the ability <q>Search your library for a Dragon card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.</q> And you can take away seven loyalty to activate the ability <q>Destroy all non-Dragon creatures.</q></p>
				<p>At first glance, this deck appears to be a Dragon tribal deck. However, not only is there not a single Dragon in the whole deck, there's not a single creature in the whole deck. It's secretly a planeswalker deck. There are 21 planeswalkers in this 100 card deck, not including Sivitri herself.</p>
				<p>The deck is tough to go up against, because all I do is offer difficult decision after difficult decision to my opponents. How will you stop me if you're attacking my planeswalkers? How will you stop my planeswalkers if you're attacking me? Just how long can you keep paying 2 life to attack?</p>
				<p>So how does it win if there are no creatures to attack my opponents with? The general idea is to get this combo going where I can infinitely activate my planeswalkers abilities. From here, there are several planeswalkers that can win the game. The main combo pieces are: <ul> <li>The Chain Veil<li>Isochron Scepter (exiling Dramatic Reversal)<li>Enough mana rocks to generate at least four mana such as Thran Dynamo and Arcane Signet </ul>
				<p>By activating The Chain Veil, I can activate planeswalkers abilities this turn as if none of their abilities have been activated. I then activate Isochron Scepter to cast a copy of Dramatic Reversal, untapping all nonland permanents I control. I then add four mana from those mana rocks to activate The Chain Veil again. Repeating this cycle, I can infinitely activate planeswalkers.</p>
				<p>That is just the main combo though. I can also substitute Isochron Scepter for Teferi, Temporal Archmage enchanted with Teferi's Talent. Assuming I control a planeswalker who can draw me a card, this combo has the same result. Activate The Chain Veil. Take away one loyalty from Teferi to <q>Untap up to four target permanents</q>. Untap those mana rocks. Add four mana from those mana rocks to activate The Chain Veil again. Infinite planeswalker activations.</p>
				<p>Another substitution for this combo is if I get the minus eight ability from Tamiyo, the Moon Sage. It says <q>You have no maximum handsize and whenever a card is put into your graveyard from anywhere, you may return it to your hand</q>. If I have this effect, I can infinitely cast Lotus Petal and sacrifice it for one mana of any color, since it costs zero mana and will be returned to my hand. Infinitely casting Lotus Petal will give me infinite proliferate, an effect that allows me to give any permanent with a counter, an additional counter. This combo works if Inexorable Tide is on the battlefield. It reads <q>Whenever you cast a spell, proliferate.</q> A substitute for that, is Ichormoon Gauntlet. It reads <q>Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, choose a counter on target permanent. Put an additional counter of that kind of that permanent.</q> What's worse is that Ichormoon Guantlet give my planeswalkers the ability <q>Minus 12: Take an extra turn after this one.</q> Essentially giving me infinite turns.</p>
				<p>Lastly, the deck includes a lot of ways to slow down my opponents and speed up my planeswalkers. Cards that help slow down my opponents: <ul> <li>Cyclonic Rift<li>Evacuation<li>Toxic Deluge </ul>
				<p>Cards that speed up my planeswalkers: <ul> <li>Contentious Plan<li>Staff of Compleation<li>Vivisurgeon's Insight </ul>
